<h1>Family</h1>

<h2>Family means a lot to me, I love all of my family members very dearly. We are five people in my family, me,
    my mom, my dad and my two younger brothers. Even though I don't see them very often because I live on the other side of the world
we still talk on facetime and and text back and fourth. Since I have been in the US for five years both me and them have gotten
    use to me not being around. In the beginning it wasen't always easy but they know just as well as I that im here for a good reason and to chase my dreams.    </h2>
