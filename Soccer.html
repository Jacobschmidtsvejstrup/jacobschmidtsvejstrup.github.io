<h1>Soccer</h1>
<h2>In Europe soccer is the biggest sport, most people like the sport and will follow a team and watch when the national team play.
    I am from just outside Copenhagen so the team I follow is F. C. Copenhagen, They are the biggest team in the country because the play
in Capital. When I am home over the summer I love going to the games and cheer on the team,
    The atmosphere at the stadium is unbelievable and it makes the games a lot of fun to go to.</h2>
